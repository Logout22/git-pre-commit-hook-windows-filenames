## Installation
Copy the file pre-commit to .git/hooks and make it executable.

By executing
```sh
git config hooks.enforcecompatiblefilenames true
```
you can then enable the hook.

## Testing
Clone the repository and execute ./test-hook.sh

## Limitation
The maximum absolute file path can not be reliable enforced as the path length
leading to the repository root is unknown for other clients.
